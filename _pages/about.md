title: About me
---

Since graduating in the summer of 2007 I have worked for a few companies around the Belfast area in industries including insurance, telecommunications, 
internet of things and digital asset management.

For the last 4 years I have been working as the Principal Architect at [Oroson](https://oroson.co), working remotely (pre Zoom I must add!) building a B2C/B2B SaaS platform.

My every day tech stack is a bunch of Java & Spring microservices, Typescript & Angular web apps, Node.js & Electron desktop apps
along with Swift & iOS and Kotlin & Android native apps with the odd Node.js AWS Lambda. 
All powered by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) with a light touch of [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

# Why blog?

It has been something that I have been meaning to start for at least the last five years if not longer. I have worked on a ton of 
interesting problems across both servers (back-end) and various clients (front-end) that I'd like to share.

Like most developers when you start a new piece of work, you scope out the solution and get straight into the code. 
You hit a roadblock or two they when you finally hit that eureka moment you say "I must write a blog about that", 
as you think that might come in useful for someone else.

I'm also doing it for mildly selfish reasons as I would like to try to keep a rough tab on some interesting problems I have architected and 
implemented a solution for as the years go by.
