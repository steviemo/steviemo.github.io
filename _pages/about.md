title: About me
---

Since graduating in the summer of 2007 I have worked for a few companies around the Belfast area in industries including insurance, telecommunications, 
internet of things and digital asset management.

For the last 4 years I have been working as Principal Architect at [Oroson](https://oroson.co), working remotely (pre Zoom I must add!) building a B2C/B2B SaaS platform.

Nearly all of my professional life has been working in a Java/Spring based servers with a mix of web apps including Grails and AngularJS. 
Though my every day tech stack these days is Java/Spring microservices, Typescript/Angular web app, Node.js/Electron desktop app,
Swift/iOS app and Kotlin/Android app with the odd Node.js AWS Lambda.

# Why blog?

It has been something that I have been meaning to start for at least the last five years if not longer. I have worked on a ton of 
interesting problems across servers and multiple clients that I'd like to share.

Like most developers when you start a new piece of work, you scope out the solution and get straight into the code. 
You hit a roadblock or two they when you finally hit that eureka moment you say "I must write a blog about that", 
as you think that might come in useful for someone else.

I'm also doing it for selfish reasons to try and keep a rough tab on some of the cooler more interesting problems I have come across.
